# Datasheet Template

The Datasheet is made out of 1358 records of estimates for different cardboard boxes
Columns are:
1.	Size of the carton in cubic mm
2.	Board thickness. gm2
3.	Board Cost. currency
4.	Ink coverage. 0= none, 1 small 2=large
5.	Ink Cost. currency
6.	Make Ready cost. currency
7.	Quantity. carton units
 

## Motivation

- The data was created for the purpose of estimating a price given the previous inputs. They were created by an old none existing anymore packaging company. 
- The dataset was created by a company called Pharmaflex, which doesn't exist anymore. The dataset was created between 1996 and 1997 before it close down.

 
## Composition

- The data consist of price estimates generated during 2 years for different sizes of cardboard packaging
- There are 1358 estimates
- There is no missing data
- All the data is numerical and doesn't contains any confidential data

## Collection process

- The data was acquired when closing down the company from one of the databases with permission of the owner. 
- The data is nota subset. Only records containing missing data were deleted
- The data was collected between 1996 and 1997

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- The data was preprocessed. All records with missing data were removed. 
- Raw data was saved in a separate file.
 
## Uses

- The data could be used for historical purposes if wanting to find out what size of packaging was trending, or if there was any seasonality to the estimates of cartons. 
- Nothing on this dataset has been identifies to have any potential Bias
- This dataset must be used only for task to do with flexographic printing process and specifically with narrow web printing. This data must not be used for litho as the estimating process is very different

## Distribution

- The data hasn't been distributed before
- No 

## Maintenance

- It is not maintained
